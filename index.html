 ( Hover over here!!! ) </h1>

The world is home to millions of species of animals; 8.7 to be precise! Some we haven’t even discovered yet! But the question is, do you have your facts right? Well, I’m here to show you what’s right and what’s wrong. Hi, I’m Hanaan and I’m 10 years old. On this website, I’ll teach you about the different types of animals and their habitats.



<h2>ANIMALS  IN  THE  AMAZON  RAINFOREST </h2>


There are 2,505 types of animal that live in the Amazon rainforest. They are a mixture of jaguars, sloths, dolphins, macaws, anacondas, frogs, and much, much more. Some of them live on the land, in the sky, or in the water. From the tall trees to the pristine waters filled with piranha, the Amazonian animals and bugs inhabit the whole of the 5.5 million kilometres of rainforest. There are 4 layers of the Amazon rainforest. The first one is called the Emergent Layer. It is the highest of the 4 layers. The layer below the Emergent layer is called the canopy. The next one down is the understory, and the bottom layer is called the floor. [ Unsurprisingly! ]

<p>
 There are 400 different tribes in the Amazon rainforest, made up of around 2,500 people per tribe !!! There are about 1 million Indians altogether. Here are some names of a few tribes:

  <ul>
   <li>The Achagua  tribe </li>
   <li> The Apalai tribe </li>
   <li> The Aruan tribe </li>
</ul>
And so many more! 
  </p>

But their home is in danger of severe deforestation. The huge rainforest loses 150 acres of land every minute of every day. Already 20% of the Amazon is gone. Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest started in the 1970s, and people are still doing it today. Are we really doing this to the largest rainforest in the world?
